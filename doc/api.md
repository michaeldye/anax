## Horizon APIs

This document contains the Horizon REST APIs for the Horizon agent running on an edge node. The output of the APIs is in JSON compact format. To get a better view, you can use the JSONView extension in your web browser or use the `jq` command from the command line interface. For example:

```
curl -s http://<ip>/status | jq '.'
```

      "organization": "mycompany",
      "pattern": "pat3",
      "name": "mydevice",
      "token": "dfjskjdsfkj"
    }'  http://localhost/node

```


#### **API:** PATCH  /node
---

Update the agent's exchange token. This API can only be called when configstate is "configuring".

**Parameters:**

body:

| name | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| id   | string | the agent's unique exchange id. |
| token | string | the agent's authentication token for the exchange. |

**Response:**

code:

* 200 -- success

**Example:**
```
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{
      "id": "mydevice",
      "token": "kj123idifdfjsklj"
    }'  http://localhost/node

```

#### **API:** DELETE  /node
---

Unconfigure the agent so that it can be re-configured. All agreements are cancelled, workloads, microservices and blockchain containers are stopped. The API could take minutes to send a respone if invoked with block=true. This API can only be called when configstate is "configured" or "configuring". After calling this API, configstate will be changed to "unconfiguring" while the agent quiesces, and then it will become "unconfigured".

**Parameters:**

| name | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| block | bool | If true (the default), the API blocks until the agent is quiesced. If false, the caller will get control back quickly while the quiesce happens in the background. While this is occurring, the caller should invoke GET /node until they receive an HTTP status 404. |
| removeNode | bool | If true, the nodeâ€™s entry in the exchange is also deleted, instead of just being cleared. The default is false. |

**Response:**

code:

* 204 -- success

body:

none

**Example:**
```
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X DELETE "http://localhost/node?block=true&removeNode=false"
```


#### **API:** GET  /node/configstate
---

Get the current configuration state of the agent.

**Parameters:**

none

**Response:**

code:
* 200 -- success

body:

| name | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| state   | string | Current configuration state of the agent. Valid values are "configuring", "configured", "unconfiguring", and "unconfigured". |
| last_update_time | uint64 | timestamp when the state was last updated. |

**Example:**

```
curl -s http://localhost/node/configstate |jq '.'
{
  "state": "configured",
  "last_update_time": 1510174292
}
```


#### **API:** PUT  /node/configstate
---

Change the configuration state of the agent. The valid values for the state are "configuring" and "configured". The "unconfigured" state is not settable through this API. The agent starts in the "configuring" state. You can change the state to "configured" after you have set the agent's pattern through the /node API, and have configured all the microservice and workload user input variables through the /microservice/config and /workload/config APIs. The agent will advertise itself as available for microservices and workloads once it enters the "configured" state.

**Parameters:**

body:

| name | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| state  | string | the agent configuration state. The valid values are "configuring" and "configured".|


**Response:**

code:

* 201 -- success

body:

none

**Example:**
```
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{
       "state": "configured"
    }'  http://localhost/node/configstate

```
